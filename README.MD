## Repository Files Overview

This repository contains all the necessary files to deploy the PrestaShop application using Docker on Render. Each file has a specific purpose:

- **Dockerfile**: Defines how the container is built. It sets up the PHP 8.2 Apache environment, copies the PrestaShop files into the container, and ensures the application runs correctly. This demonstrates containerization and deployment knowledge.  

- **composer.json**: Manages PHP dependencies for the PrestaShop application. Composer reads this file to install required packages, ensuring the app has all the libraries it needs to function.  

- **index.php**: The main entry point of the web application. This file starts the PrestaShop application and is required for the server to serve the website correctly.  

All files are essential for deployment and should be kept in the repository. They collectively show a complete, working setup for the application.
